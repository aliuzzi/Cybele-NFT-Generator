# NFT Generator! This is the entire process to mint NFT to the Blockchain. Named Cybele, as it will be used to generate thousands of goddesses' NFTs.

Custom built NFT Smart Contract, Deploying and Minting my specified png to the Ethereum Blockchain.

# What you will need to change
- Need to plug in your own Public and Private API Keys from Alchemy.
-  Eth Wallet address.
-  ^ Highly Recommend Ropsten Test Net & a Fake Ethereum to test. -> https://fauceth.komputing.org/ you can request some test Eth here
-  NFT png or jpeg + metadata (i.e. change nft-metadata.json)
-  ^ Add both of these files into Pinata Cloud ( a pinning service that allows users to host files on the IPFS network. )

Happy Minting!
